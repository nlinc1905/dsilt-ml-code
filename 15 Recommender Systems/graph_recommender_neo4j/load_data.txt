//Cypher query to load LastFM dataset into Neo4j

//When using MERGE or MATCH with LOAD CSV we need to make sure we have an index or a unique constraint on the property that we are merging on. This will ensure that the query executes in a performant way.
//These commands must be run 1 at a time
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (u:User) ASSERT u.user_id IS UNIQUE
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (a:Artist) ASSERT a.artist_id IS UNIQUE

//Replace single whitespaces in file path with %20 since it is a URL
//Comment out this line from DB settings to import from a specific path: dbms.directories.import=import
